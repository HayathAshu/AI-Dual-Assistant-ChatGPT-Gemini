# AI Dual-Engine Knowledge Assistant (ChatGPT + Gemini)

This project builds an intelligent dual-response system using two leading AI models — **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)** and **Gemini (by Google)**.  
The system takes a single question from the user and generates outputs from both AI models, allowing real-time comparison of response quality, clarity, and depth.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to compare how two different AI systems answer the **same question**.  
You provide one input → The system gives:

- 🔵 **ChatGPT Response** (via OpenAI API)  
- 🟢 **Gemini Response** (via Google AI Studio API)

This helps users understand the strengths, differences, and capabilities of both AI tools.
